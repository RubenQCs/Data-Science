# ðŸš— Vehicle Detection, Tracking, and Counting with YOLO  

This project implements a **vehicle detection, tracking, and counting system** using **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**, an advanced real-time object detection model.  

## ðŸ”¹ Project Description  
The goal of this project is to develop an efficient solution for traffic analysis, capable of:  

âœ… **Detecting vehicles in images or videos** using YOLO.  
âœ… **Tracking each vehicle** as it moves through the scene.  
âœ… **Counting detected vehicles**.  

This system can be applied in various scenarios, such as **traffic monitoring, toll management, vehicle flow analysis, and smart cities**.  

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used  
- **YOLOv11** for real-time detection.  
- **DeepSORT** for vehicle tracking.  
- **OpenCV** for video processing.  
- **Python** as the main programming language.
