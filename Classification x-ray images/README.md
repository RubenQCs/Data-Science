# üßë‚Äçüî¨ Machine Learning & Deep Learning Project  

  This project was developed using **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** to implement and compare different machine learning and deep learning models. In this repository, we will specifically describe the code implemented using **TensorFlow**. The general steps followed in this project are outlined below.  

  The general steps followed in this project are outlined below.  

## üìå General Workflow  

1. **Importing Required Packages and Modules**  
   The following packages were used for various stages of the project:
   ```python
   import os
   import shutil
   import zipfile
   import random
   import glob
   import cv2
   import numpy as np
   import tensorflow as tf
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns
   from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
   from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
   from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dropout
   from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
2. **Data Loading**  
3. **Data Visualization**  
4. **Data Preprocessing and Augmentation**  
5. **Building the Models**  
6. **Compiling and Training the Models**  
7. **Model Evaluation on Validation Data**  
8. **Model Performance Visualization**  
9. **Output Prediction and Probability Estimation on Test Data**  

This structured workflow ensures a comprehensive approach to developing, training, and evaluating machine learning models efficiently. üöÄ
